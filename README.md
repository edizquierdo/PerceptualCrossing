# Perceptual Crossing Task 

Work submitted to the Artificial Life Journal, January 2023.

This is a replication and extension of the perceptual crossing simulation studies, which are aimed at challenging methodological individualism in the analysis of social cognition by studying multi-agent real-time interactions. 

Task and agent setup (see figure). 

(*A*) The task takes place in a 1-dimensional ring where two agents face each other. Each agent can sense the other's avatar (A), a shadow of the other's avatar (S), and a fixed object (F). 

(*B) Each agent has a sensor (cyan) that can send information to all $N$ neurons (black). The neurons in the circuit are fully inter-connected, including self-connections (not depicted). The output from one neuron drives the left motor and another neuron drives the right motor (magenta). The neural circuits in the two agents are identical (i.e., they have the same parameters).
